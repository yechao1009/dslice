# dslice
Dynamic slicing is a method designed for dependency detection between a categorical covariates variable and a continuous response variable. This method is based on a likelihood-ratio test statistic calculated by searching an optimal discretization of the continuous variable. By assigning a prior probability to each possible discretization scheme, a Bayesian version of dynamic slicing could be applied to investigate the independence and conditional independence tests between categorical covariates and a continuous response variable.
